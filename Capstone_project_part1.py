### Capstone project ###
import timeit
''' For the first part: Find e to the Nth diget.

For the seound part: Sorting - Implement two types of sorting
    algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

For the terd part: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm - Create a program that
    finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges. or
    Minimum Spanning Tree - Create a program which takes a connected,
    undirected graph with weights and outputs the minimum
    spanning tree of the graph i.e., a subgraph that is a tree,
    contains all the vertices, and the sum of its weights is
    the least possible.

For the forth part: Product Inventory Project - Create an application
    which manages an inventory of products. Create a product class
    which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an inventory
    class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the
    inventory value. '''
